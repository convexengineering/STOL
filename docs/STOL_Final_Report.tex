\begin{abstract}
    Electric Short Takeoff and Landing (eSTOL) vehicles are proposed as a path towards implementing an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) network that reduces critical vehicle certification risks and offers advantages in vehicle performance.  An overview is given of the system constraints and key enabling technologies that must be incorporated into the design of the vehicle. The tradeoffs between vehicle performance and runway length are investigated using geometric programming, a robust optimization framework.  Runway lengths as short as 100-300 ft are shown to be feasible, depending on the level of technology and the desired cruise speed. The tradeoffs between runway length and the potential to build new infrastructure in urban centers are investigated using Boston as a representative case study.  The placement of some runways up to 600ft is shown to be possible in the urban center, with a significant increase in the number of potential locations for runways shorter than 300ft. Key challenges and risks to implementation are discussed.

\section{Introduction}
Within the aviation industry there is a strong and growing interest in the development of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks,  which are aerial transportation systems in and around major metropolitan areas.  The defining features of UAM networks are fleets of relatively small vehicles operating off a distributed network of takeoff and landing areas (TOLAs) located within dense urban centers, primarily focused on passenger transport. Past efforts at developing UAM networks based on helicopters were largely unsuccessful due to the high costs of helicopter operations, the high levels of noise generated, and the poor safety record of these aircraft\cite{Vascik2017}.  Recent advances in electric vehicle propulsion and key subsystem technologies have opened the door to new vehicle configurations that may mitigate these fundamental challenges.  The ride-sharing operational models that have been successfully developed for ground transportation also have the potential to improve the economics of UAM  operations through pooling and on-demand service. This has sparked renewed interest in the UAM concept, and there are currently over a dozen legacy and emerging aircraft manufacturers building or flight-testing UAM-specific aircraft. The majority of these vehicles are based on eVTOL (electric vertical and takeoff landing) configurations, mainly because they do not require large runways and have lower noise signatures than conventional helicopters.  

Any proposed UAM system is exposed to many sources of risk, such as local noise regulations, ATC capacity concerns, pilot or automation availability, infrastructure availability, and uncertain market demand\cite{Vascik2017}\cite{Uber}.  The most significant risk is the ability to certify a new type of vehicle because inability to certify would preclude any UAM operations.  Certifying new eVTOL aircraft is likely to be difficult because historically certifying novel types of aircraft has been extremely difficult. The AugustaWestland AW609 tiltrotor is a prime example of this;  first aiming to achieve a type certification  in 2007, the company is now hoping to achieve certification in 2018\cite{AW609}.  This paper aims to show that using a conventional, short takeoff and land (STOL) fixed-winged configuration reduces the certification risk and is also feasible for UAM operations.   

Certification risk arises from the potential for catastrophic vehicle failures and the complexity of required mitigations.  For DEP eVTOL aircraft, certification risk arises from the potential failure of three critical systems common to all configurations:  1) the active flight stabilization system that controls vehicle attitude and lift during the vertical and translational phases of flight via differential thrust 2) the power delivery system that supplies power from the batteries to the motors, and the motors themselves and 3) the batteries that store electrical power. 

Total failure of any of these systems, especially at low altitude, would constitute a catastrophic failure.  Since the motors are used for both lift and attitude control, in the event of a thrust loss there is no possibility of a controlled crash-landing like in a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. Autorotation will not be possible with DEP eVTOL aircraft due to low rotor inertias, fixed rotor pitch, and the lack of mechanical control linkages. Current ballistic recovery system are only demonstrated to work above 400ft AGL (or higher with no forward airspeed)\cite{CAPS}.  Battery failure could be especially consequential if the lithium-polymer (LiPo) batteries go into thermal runaway, where a short circuit within the battery causing an uncontrolled increase in temperature and pressure, potentially triggering a chain reaction in neighboring cells.  There are several ways a battery cell could go into thermal runaway; over-heating, -charging or -discharging, mechanical damage, or an internal short circuit caused by a manufacturing defect \cite{Doughty2012}.  Mechanical damage and especially manufacturing defects are hard to prevent with a high degree of certainty.

Currently acceptable mitigations to these risks are complex, will likely be difficult to certify, and could compromise vehicle performance. Commercial jetliners use highly redundant, isolated fly-by-wire systems.  LiPo batteries are also used to provide electrical power in commercial aircraft; there, the risks of thermal runaway are managed through redundancy, battery monitoring systems, and physical containment\cite{NYT_bat}. Hybrid-electric technology could also be used in place of a large battery system.  These mitigations add to the cost and weight of an already weight-sensitive class of aircraft.  

STOL aircraft, however, are inherently stable, so there is no need for electrically actuated controls or a flight stabilization system.  This eliminates the risks due to failure of the flight stabilization system, and precludes the loss of attitude control in the event of a loss of thrust.  While fly-by-wire may be desirable for future automated operations, initial UAM operations are expected to operate with a human pilot on board\cite{Uber}. For all-electric STOL (eSTOL) vehicles, thermal runaway in the battery system is still a significant risk.  However, STOL configurations are less sensitive to weight than VTOL configurations, lessening the performance penalty associated with a battery containment system.  These vehicles have been certified and are flying today. One example is the Helio Courier, which has a demonstrated takeoff distance of 300ft\cite{Rucker}.

STOL aircraft also have performance advantages compared to VTOL aircraft, since they need much less power to become airborne (and hence have much lighter power systems).  This translates to higher potential payloads or longer ranges. There are also potential noise benefits;  historically fixed-wing aircraft produce much lower noise levels that rotorcraft of a similar size due to their lower power levels.  There are also currently more than four times as many commercial airplane pilots as there are commercial rotorcraft pilots in the United States\cite{Airmen}. This gives STOL the competitive advantage in early implementations of UAM networks, where piloted operations are required.  

The clear downside of STOL aircraft is they require a runway of some length, which increases the infrastructure required to build a TOLA.  In dense urban areas, availability of infrastructure is severely limited.  If no runways can be placed in useful locations, or the runways that can be placed are too short for feasible vehicles, then any advantages of STOL vehicles are immaterial.  For the concept to be viable, it must be viable both from a vehicle performance and potential infrastructure availability perspective. 

The purpose of this paper is to assess the feasibility of an UAM system that features STOL aircraft from both the vehicle and infrastructure sides.  It will be determined how runway length trades with both high-level vehicle requirements (speed, range, and payload) and with the availability of potential TOLA locations in a dense urban center.  The ultimate goal is to determine whether a STOL aircraft that can land in a dense urban area can also have an operation capability useful for UAM missions. As part of this work, previous literature concerning small aircraft transportation system design \cite{Viken},\cite{Holmes}, thin-haul transportation vehicles\cite{Harish},\cite{Kreimeier},\cite{Justin}, VTOL aircraft\cite{Duffy}, and STOL aircraft is considered\cite{Antcliff},\cite{SeeleyIV}. 
 
\section{Vehicle Requirements Definition and Market Analysis}
To perform a feasibility study of this new class of aircraft, the high-level vehicle requirements (range, speed, and payload) must be established, which arise from the projected use case of UAM vehicles.  The clearest need for an urban air mobility system arises from the traffic problem that plagues most major metropolitan areas.  Large numbers of people travel into and out of the urban center every day, creating massive surface congestion that extends for miles outside of the city.  To be an effective alternative to ground transportation, a UAM vehicle must have sufficient range to bypass this congestion, and preferably to be located near the homes of the commuting population, as well as speed that offers significant time savings over an automobile.  
To estimate the range and speed requirements for a UAM vehicle, three representative US cities were considered; Boston, Dallas, and Los Angeles.  

Figure \ref{f:commute} shows average commuting times in the area surrounding each city as reported by the 2011 US Census (top)\cite{WNYC}and representative traffic congestion during rush hour from Google Maps (bottom)\cite{GMaps}.   It can be seen from these maps that a range of at least 50 nmi is required to bypass the surface congestion surrounding the city, and a range of 100nmi gives good access to the majority of the commuting population.   For this reason, 100 nmi (plus required reserves) will be used as a baseline range requirement.  A design cruise speed requirement of at least 100kts will also be included.  This is selected as a reasonable value that offers significant time savings over ground transportation (especially with traffic); the effects of increasing or decreasing the speed and range requirements will be assessed in detail in subsequent sections.  

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{\textbf{Surface congestion surrounding major metropolitan areas drives the need for urban air transportation}}
	\label{f:commute}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The payload requirements for the vehicle are derived from the need to carry both a pilot (in initial operations) as well as a sufficient number of passengers. Uber and others have shown there to be a potential market for vehicles carrying only a pilot and a single passenger, but that more passengers improves the economic viability of the concept\cite{Uber}.  This is especially true in early operations before widespread vehicle automation, where the number of pilots is likely to be limited by pilot availability, and the number of vehicle operations may be limited by ATC constraints.   The number of passengers onboard is also expected to trade with vehicle size, and hence required runway length.  Therefore, for this study there is a minimum requirement of at least one pilot and one passenger, to provide a common baseline with VTOL concepts.  A key goal is to determine how required runway length scales as the number of passengers are increased.  The design mission for this feasibility study is summarized in Table \ref{t:design_mission}.  This is similar to the design missions proposed for other UAM vehicles\cite{Uber}, \cite{Antcliff}.  These requirements form the basis of the vehicle design space exploration conducted in Section IV to determine how short of a runway is feasible, while not violating the high-level vehicle requirements.

In order for this concept to be viable (for any type of vehicle), there must be infrastructure available to support the takeoff and landing operations at both the origin and the destination.  Initial operations would ideally take advantage of existing infrastructure where possible. Figure \ref{f:inf_avail} shows the existing air transportation infrastructure around the same three cities.  The top row shows existing public use airports, while the bottom row shows a close-up of the urban core that is the destination for most commuters.  From this it can be seen that surrounding most cities there is a significant amount of existing small airports that are well suited to UAM operations.  However, in the urban core existing air infrastructure, for either VTOL or STOL aircraft, is very limited.  Many existing helipads are also reserved for medical operations, so for both Dallas and Boston being able to use existing VTOL infrastructure does not offer a significant advantage over using existing STOL infrastructure (airports); in both cases, significant additional infrastructure development will be required to operate a network at any scale.  Los Angeles, due to it's law requiring helipads for emergency evacuations of tall structures, does have substantial VTOL infrastructure.   However, that law was unique to that one particular city and is not indicative of larger trends\cite{Vascik2017}.

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{\textbf{Surface congestion surrounding major metropolitan areas drives the need for urban air transportation}}
	\label{f:inf_avail}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

If significant new infrastructure investments are required in any case to make the UAM vision a reality, then the feasibility of the STOL UAM concept rests strongly on whether there are sufficient potential locations to build new TOLAs in these urban cores.  Clearly, whether this is a feasible proposition is strongly dependent on how long of a runway is required.  At the scale of conventional commercial aircraft, with required runways lengths in the thousands of feet, it will infeasible to build substantial new infrastructure.  On the other end of the spectrum, VTOL aircraft maximize the number of potential infrastructure locations, although noise considerations may prove to be a significant limiting factor.  However, the trade space in between these two ends of the spectrum is poorly understood. Boston will therefore be used as an example case study to examine the effects of the runway length on feasible infrastructure locations.  This study is shown in Section V.   

\section{Vehicle Design Considerations and Key Enabling Technologies}
STOL aircraft make design compromises to achieve short-field performance, the significance of which increase as the required runway length becomes shorter.  This section will discuss some of the key vehicle-level trades involved in designing an aircraft for short-field performance, and will discuss some of the ways that emerging electric aircraft technologies will offer improved performance over historical vehicles. 

\paragraph{Short Takeoff and Landing Considerations}
Figure ~\ref{f:takeoff} shows a simplified sketch of the aircraft during takeoff (top) and landing (bottom).  At a high level, the runway a vehicle operates off of must be equal to the larger of either the takeoff or landing distances.  To shorten the runway, both the takeoff and landing distances $S_{TO}$ and $S_{land}$ must be reduced.  The takeoff distance is a function of the time it takes the aircraft to reach a given liftoff speed $V_{LO}$, which is a multiple of the vehicle stall speed as required\cite{ASTM3179}.  The stall speed is related to the physical aircraft parameters by Equation \ref{e:stall}.  To reduce the takeoff distance, the vehicle design can be changed such that it reaches the liftoff speed faster by increasing the thrust, or the liftoff speed can be lower by decreasing the wing loading $W/S$ or by increasing the wing $CL_{max}$.  These changes also serve to increase the climb angle $\gamma_{climb}$, which is desirable to minimize the time spent at low altitude. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{takeoff_fig.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Considerations for short takeoff and landing}}
	\label{f:takeoff}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:stall}
    V_{\mathrm{TD,TO}} = 1.3V_{\mathrm{stall}} = \sqrt{\frac{2W_{\mathrm{MTO}}}{\rho S C_{L_{\mathrm{max}}}}}.
\end{equation}
Decreased $W/S_{ref}$ and increased $CL_{max}$ also help reduce the landing distance, since they reduce the touchdown speed $V_{TD}$.  Additionally, the landing distance may be shortened by increasing the drag after touchdown, either by wheel brakes, aerodynamic braking, or reverse thrust.  

For these reasons, compared to conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft of the same size, STOL vehicles tend to be more lightly wing loaded, have high power-to-weight ratios, and have large and complex high-lift systems to maximize $CL_{max}$.  To first order, high power-to-weight ratios and complex high-lift systems both add significant weight to the system, with second-order penalties on efficiency.  For a given aircraft, decreasing wing loading below its optimal value will limit the top speed of the vehicle, as well as making it more sensitive to wind gusts.  It will also increase the power required to cruise at a given speed, requiring additional fuel or batteries, or reducing range.  For these reasons, and since short field capability is not required at most airports, STOL aircraft have not been widely adopted outside of the bush pilot community. 

The introduction of new electric aircraft technologies offer a variety of potential improvements over existing STOL aircraft, giving them significant advantages both in the UAM market and relative to current STOL vehicles.  This is similar to the way these technologies are being proposed to change vertical flight.  The following are the key technologies that are considered for an electric STOL (eSTOL) aircraft.  The impact of each technology will be assessed at a conservative baseline level, as well as a more agressive advanced level to show the potential impact of technological improvements.  
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.4\textwidth}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{x-57.jpg}
    \caption{\textbf{The NASA X-57 will demonstrate the benefits of distributed electric propulsion for fixed-wing aircraft \cite{NASAWeb}}}
	\label{f:x57}
	\end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}
\paragraph{Distributed Electric Propulsion}
DEP is a collection of enabling technologies (high specific energy batteries, electric motors and controllers) that enable the replacement of a few large propulsors with many smaller ones.  The NASA X-57 shown in Figure \ref{f:x57} is an example of a fixed-wing DEP configuration currently being developed.   This novel propulsion system architecture allows optimization of different parts of the propulsion system for different phases of flight, which increases overall efficiency.  It also increases system redundancy, and most importantly for this application increases the effectiveness of the wing through blown lift (discussed below).  From a modeling perspective, it also allows cruise efficiency to be treated independently of takeoff power.  References \cite{StollDEP} and \cite{MooreDEP} discuss the benefits of DEP in more detail. 

\paragraph{Blown Lift}
Blown lift increases the effective wing lift coefficient through two main effects.  The first is the increase in effective dynamic pressure over the wing due to the accelerated propeller wake.  The second is the interaction between the propeller wake and the flaps, which turn the wake downward and produce an upwards force as a result\cite{MooreDEP}.  Figure \ref{f:blown_lift} is from a NASA investigation into the effectiveness of blown lift\cite{Deere}.  It shows, for an X-57 like wing, that substantial increases in effective wing CL are possible.  As a conservative estimate, 4.0 was used as our baseline value of takeoff $CL_{max}$, and 5.0 for the advanced value.  The results of this study have been largely validated through ground testing\cite{Stoll2015}. 

 \begin{figure}[!h]
 	\begin{center}
 	\includegraphics[width = 1.\textwidth]{blown_lift_chart.pdf}
     \caption{\textbf{NASA modeling shows significant increases in $CL_{max}$ due to blown lift~\cite{Deere}}}
 	\label{f:blown_lift}
 	\end{center}
 \end{figure}
 
From this figure it should be noted that high power settings are required to achieve large $CL_{max}$, especially in the landing configuration.  As discussed by Patterson\cite{Patterson2017}, this may limit the extent to which blown lift can be utilized during the approach phase of flight.  If the power required to achieve a high lift coefficient for a given vehicle exceeds the power required for a given approach angle (or level flight in the limit), then it is not useful for landing.  This effect may be offset by adding drag (spoilers, windmilling propellers) which would also have the beneficial effect of increasing approach angle; this is a key vehicle-level trade study.  Based on the drag polars given in \cite{Deere}, an X-57 like aircraft would be limited to a $CL_{max}$ of 3.5 on approach without a high-drag system; for the purposes of this paper that is used as the conservative approach $CL_{max}$, and 4.5 is used for the aggressive case.  

\paragraph{High Power Electric Motors}
Apart from their role as an enabling component of DEP, electric motors have two other useful capabilities for electric aircraft.  The first is the ability to be operated at power settings significantly higher than maximum continuous power for short periods of time.  Since high power is most important for a short time at takeoff, this effect could significantly minimize the weight penalty of a high-power propulsion system\cite{Moore_Mis}. Additionally, the rotation direction of these motors can be electrically reversed.  This is useful on braking to provide reverse thrust/massive drag at touchdown, which shortens landing distance without the weight penalty of dedicated thrust reversal systems.  

\paragraph{Advanced Flight Controls}
Autoland systems, which allow highly repeatable and precise landings, have become ubiquitous on commercial aircraft and have been proposed for emergency use in GA aircraft as well\cite{Siegel2012}.  In this context, a highly accurate autoland or landing guidance system could be used to reduce the margin of safety between the vehicle actual landing distance and required runway length.  Additionally, research is being done into autonomous post-stall landing maneuvers for fixed-wing micro air vehicles (MAVs)\cite{Moore_Perch} which could enable dynamic landing maneuvers near the vehicle stall speed.  Neither of these technologies are considered for the conservative technology variant, but are included in the aggressive technology package.  All these technologies are summarized in Table \ref{t:tech}.

\section{Vehicle Feasibility}

A sizing study using geometric programming (GP) optimization was performed to understand how short takeoff and landing requirements affect vehicle performance and design. 
This section describes the assumptions and equations used in the optimization model for vehicle size, cruise performance, and takeoff and landing distances.

Geometric programming was selected as a means of evaluating this trade space because of its speed and reliability.  
Geometric programming is a special type of convex, non-linear optimzation\cite{gp}.
Because it is convex, even GPs with thousands of variables can be solved quickly\cite{gp}.
Additionally, recent research has shown that GPs can be used to effectively evaulate aircraft design trade spaces\cite{burton_solar_2017}\cite{gpkit}.


\subsection{Vehicle Model}

It is assumed that the aircraft is completely electric, relying only on battery power for powered flight. 
The aircraft weight is comprised of the battery, payload, wing, motor, and structural weight,

\begin{equation}
    W_{\mathrm{MTO}} \geq W_{\mathrm{batt}} + N_{\mathrm{pax}}W_{\mathrm{pax}} + W_{\mathrm{wing}} + W_{\mathrm{motor}} + W_{\mathrm{struct}}
\end{equation}

where the motor, passenger, and structural weights are

\begin{align}
    W_{\mathrm{motor}} &\geq \frac{P_{\mathrm{shaft-max}}}{(P/W)_{\mathrm{motor}}} \\
    W_{\mathrm{pax}} &= 195\mathrm {  [lbf]}\\
    W_{\mathrm{struct}} &\geq W_{\mathrm{MTO}}f_{\mathrm{struct}}.
\end{align}

Passenger weight estimates are based on FAA guidance~\cite{AC120}. The battery weight is constrained by the range of the aircraft

\begin{equation}
    R \leq \frac{h_{\mathrm{batt}} W_{\mathrm{batt}} \eta_{\mathrm{elec}} V}{gP_{\mathrm{shaft}}}
\end{equation}

where the shaft power is 

\begin{equation}
    P_{\mathrm{shaft}} \geq \frac{TV}{\eta_{\mathrm{prop}}}
\end{equation}

The aircraft is assumed to be in steady level flight during cruise. 

The wing weight is composed of the skin, main spar and additional components

\begin{align}
    W_{\mathrm{wing}} &\geq W_{\mathrm{skin}} + W_{\mathrm{spar}} + W_{\mathrm{fadd}} \\
    W_{\mathrm{fadd}} &\geq 1.3W_{\mathrm{wing}} 
\end{align}
Where $fadd$ accounts for the required weight of flaps, slats, and additional structural components. The skin and structural elements are assumed to be carbon fiber.  
The wing spar configuration is a cap spar with unidirectional carbon fiber caps wrapped in a shear web as shown in Figure~\ref{f:capspar}.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{capspar.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Cross sectional view of a cap spar.}}
	\label{f:capspar}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The spar dimensions are sized such that the material stresses are not exceeded under a 3.5 g-load,

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\mathrm{CFRP}} \geq \frac{\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{root}}}{S_{y_{\mathrm{spar}}}}
\end{equation}

The root wing moment $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{root}}$, is calculated assuming a distributed load along the wing span that scales with the local chord.\cite{bending}
A constant tapered wing is assumed.  
This wing sizing model leverages the GP wing sizing model used by Burton and Hoburg.\cite{burton_solar_2017} 

A simple drag model is used for the aircraft, 

\begin{equation}
    C_D \geq CDA + c_{d_p} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi e AR}.
\end{equation}

where the profile drag coefficient $c_{d_p}(C_L, Re)$, is calculated from a representative wing polar. 
The combined drag and wing loading models allow the aspect ratio to be optimized, trading structural weight with aerodynamic performance. 

\subsection{Takeoff and Landing Models}
The takeoff model was adapted from Raymer's takeoff equations to fit a GP compatible form\cite{Raymer2006}.  Using equations of motion the takeoff state can be expressed

\begin{equation}
    T - D - \mu(W_{\mathrm{MTO}} - L) = \frac{W_{\mathrm{MTO}}}{g} \frac{dV}{dt}.
\end{equation}
This can be simplified to 
\begin{align}
    \frac{dV}{dt} &= g \left( \frac{T}{W_{\mathrm{MTO}}} - \mu \right) - \frac{g}{W_{\mathrm{MTO}}} \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho S V^2 (C_{D_g} - \mu C_{L_g})\right) \\
    \label{e:todiff}
    \frac{dt}{dV} &= \frac{1}{A-BV^2}
\end{align}
The takeoff ground run distance can then be expressed by taking the integral of Equation \ref{e:todiff} to achieve

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:to}
    S_{\mathrm{TO}} = \frac{1}{2B} \ln{\frac{A}{A-BV^2}} 
\end{equation}
The natural log function can be approximated to make Equation~\ref{e:to} GP-compatible by 

\begin{equation}
    \ln{\frac{A}{A-BV^2}} \approx \num{5.6e-4} A^{-6.04} (BV^2)^{6.04} + 1.0 A^{-0.001} (BV^2)^{0.001} + \num{7.5e-4} A^{-1.276} (BV^2)^{1.275}
\end{equation}
with an average log error of 0.06\%.  The terms $A$, and $B$, are constrained by

\begin{align}
    \frac{T}{W_{\mathrm{MTO}}} &\geq \frac{A}{g} + \mu \\
    B &\geq \frac{g}{W_{\mathrm{MTO}}} \frac{1}{2} \rho S C_{D_g}
\end{align}
where the $\mu C_{L_g}$ term is neglected as a conservative approximation for $B$ to preserve GP-compatibility. The landing ground roll distance is calculated using conservation of energy, 

\begin{equation}
    \label{e:sgr}
    S_{\mathrm{land}} \geq \frac{1}{2} \frac{V^2}{Ng} 
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the deceleration factor ($N=1$ corresponds to a 1-g deceleration). 

The deceleration factor is a function of the technologies used to stop the aircraft and include, but are not limited to: brakes, reverse thrust from electric motors, and drag.  This was used instead of a more conventional braking model because, as discussed subsequently, these vehicles are driven primarily by landing constraints.  This creates an incentive to use some type of thrust reversal or dedicated braking thrust system to shorten the landing distance.  The details of this system are an important vehicle level design trade; the landing deceleration used in this system-level study becomes the design requirement for a future vehicle design effort. Passenger comfort and system weight are additional considerations.  
To understand how the g-loading constant varies with different amounts of reverse thrust, the ground roll and deceleration factor are calculated for the X-57 as an example case. 
Table~\ref{t:landingdecel} shows the deceleration factor for different amounts of reverse thrust. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Landing Case for the X-57}
    \label{t:landingdecel}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    \toprule
                                    & Ground          & Deceleration \\ 
                                    & Roll Distance   & Factor ($N$)\\ \hline
    Brakes only (dry)               &  925 [ft]       & 0.37  \\
    Brakes + 10\% reverse thrust    &  850 [ft]       & 0.4   \\
    Brakes + 50\% reverse thrust    &  625 [ft]       & 0.55  \\
    Brakes + 100\% reverse thrust   &  425 [ft]       & 0.73  \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For both the landing and takeoff constraints it is assumed that the velocity has a 30\% margin above the stall velocity\cite{ASTM3179}.
For the purposes of this study, deceleration corresponding to braking with a small amount of reverse thrust (.4g) was used for the conservative case, while a more powerful thrust reversal system (.7g) was used for the aggressive case. 
It is assumed that the the max lift coefficient is different for landing and takeoff.
A 40\% margin is placed on the ground roll distance to determine runway length\cite{PilotGuide}.  For this vehicle, balanced field length considerations were not considered as the loss of a single engine is only a small reduction in total thrust.  Because the majority of sites being considered are elevated, takeoff or landing distance over a 35ft obstacle was not included in the model.  It will be evaluated on a case by case basis for different runway locations.

\begin{align}
    S_{\mathrm{runway}} &\geq 1.4S_{\mathrm{TO}} \\
    S_{\mathrm{runway}} &\geq 1.4S_{\mathrm{land}} 
\end{align}

\subsection{Vehicle Trade Studies}

Using the geometric programming model of a STOL aircraft perviously described, tradeoffs between runway length and vehicle performance were evaluated.  The models consists of 105 free variables and can be solved in approximately 0.1 seconds. 
Because aircraft cost scales with aircraft weight as a first order approximation, the objective function throughout is to minimize weight, $\min{(W_{\mathrm{MTO}})}$. 
Key parameter values are defined in Table~\ref{t:params}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Design Parameters}
    \label{t:params}
    \begin{tabular}{l c}

    $C_{L_{\mathrm{max}}}$ (TO)                 & 4.0           \\
    $N$                                         & 0.4g          \\
    $\eta_{\mathrm{prop}}$                      & 0.8           \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To understand how passenger and runway requirements affect vehicle weight, the GP model was solved 30 times in 3.46 seconds.  
The results are shown in Figure~\ref{f:sw_mtow}, each point on the graph corresponding to a unique optimization solution for vehicle size.  
From this study it is observed that runway lengths shorter than 250 ft are nearly infeasible for this set of parameters.  
It is also observed that the runway length is fairly insensitive to number of passengers.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \begin{subfigmatrix}{2}% number of columns
     \subfigure[\label{f:sw_mtow}Contours of number of passengers]{\includegraphics[]{sw_mtow.pdf}}
     \subfigure[\label{f:sw_mtowsens}Sensitivity to landing and takeoff constraints]{\includegraphics[]{sw_mtowsens.pdf}}
 \end{subfigmatrix}
    \caption{\textbf{Trade space of aircraft weight, number of passengers and runway length.}}
 \label{f:sw_mt}
\end{figure}

To effectively shorten the field length it is important to know whether the vehicle size is driven by the landing or takeoff constraints. 
Qualitatively, the landing model has a direct effect on wing loading as shown in Equations~\ref{e:sgr} and~\ref{e:stall}.  
The takeoff model primarily effects the thrust to weight ratio but also has a small effect on the wing loading (Equation~\ref{e:to}). 
The effect of the thrust to weight ratio $(T/W)$ and the wing loading $(W/S)$ is shown in figure~\ref{f:to_land_arg}.
The thrust to weight ratio drives the motor weight.  
The wing loading drives the wing size, which in turn drives the wing weight, drag and ultimately battery weight.  
This argument implies that the landing model would constrain the vehicle size. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{to_land_arg.pdf}
    \caption{\textbf{Effect of thrust to weight and wing loading ratios on vehicle size.}}
	\label{f:to_land_arg}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

The hypothesis that vehicle size is more constrained by landing is confirmed by looking at the sensitivity to both the landing and takeoff models. 
The sensitivity to a variable in a geometric program is defined as the percentage change in the objective function for a 1\% change in that variable's value.  
Therefore, if the sensitivity to the landing constraints is greater in magnitude than the sensitivity to the take off constraints, the system is landing constrained.  
Figure~\ref{f:sw_mtowsens} shows this is the case for these aircraft.
The sensitivity to the takeoff constraints is not zero because the takeoff model requires a thrust to weight ratio which determines the motor weight. 


\subsection{Requirement Trade Studies}

Because of the low wing loading required by the takeoff and landing models, the optimum cruise speed of STOL vehicles are fairly slow.
Therefore, a minimum cruise speed requirement is imposed in the model,

\begin{equation}
    V_{\mathrm{cruise}} \geq V_{\mathrm{min}}.
\end{equation}

The minimum speed requirement affects the cruise power requirement and consequently the amount of batteries needed.  
One way to achieve higher range or shorter runways is to decrease the required minimum speed during cruise.  
Conversely, flying faster requires shorter ranges or longer runways.
This trade off is shown in Figure~\ref{f:minspeed}.
The flat portion of the curves indicates that the aircraft is not constrained by the minimum cruise speed (i.e. that constraint is not active) because the optimum cruise speed for that set of requirements is faster than the minimum cruise speed.

 \end{subfigmatrix}
 \caption{\textbf{Trade study between requirements of runway length, minimum speed and range.}}
 \label{f:minspeed}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Advanced Technology Trade Studies}

The previous section showed fundamental trade studies and trends for how runway length varies with performance.  
It is also possible to shorten runway length through advanced technology. 
As discussed previously, a number of technologies could help reduce the required runway length including power bursts from electric motors, reverse thrust on landing, advanced flight controls, and improved battery technology.  
The effect of these technology advances on required runway length can be observed by changing a few parameters from the baseline conservative case and re-solving the optimization model.
Table~\ref{t:techparams} compares the conservative parameters to the aggressive technology parameters that were assumed in the optimization model based off of the technologies discussed in Table~\ref{t:tech}. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Advanced Technology Parameter Assumptions}

    Advanced flight controls    & Runway margin                     & 40\%                & 20\%             \\
    Advanced flight controls    & Stall speed margin                & 30\%                & 10\%             \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Understanding the extremes between the conservative case and a more aggressive case is useful in determining a feasible vehicle design and vehicle requirements. 
Figure~\ref{f:sw_mtt} shows the same trade study as figure~\ref{f:sw_mt}, but with the updated parameter values shown in Table~\ref{t:techparams}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \begin{subfigmatrix}{2}% number of columns
     \subfigure[\label{f:sw_mtowt}Contours of number of passengers]{\includegraphics[]{sw_mtowt.pdf}}
     \subfigure[\label{f:sw_mtowtsens}Sensitivity to landing constraints]{\includegraphics[]{sw_mtowtsens.pdf}}
 \end{subfigmatrix}
    \caption{\textbf{Trade space of aircraft weight, number of passengers and runway length for advanced technology assumptions.}}
 \label{f:sw_mtt}
\end{figure}

As observed in figure~\ref{f:sw_mtowt}, the advanced technology assumptions allow for a much shorter runway than the baseline case showing that runways below even 100 ft might be possible. 
To understand which parameters have the largest effect on this trade study, each parameter can be varied one at a time from the baseline case. 
Figure~\ref{f:tech} show variations on the 5 passenger contour from figure~\ref{f:sw_mtow}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
 \begin{subfigmatrix}{3}% number of columns
     \subfigure[\label{f:smtow_clmax}Contours of $C_{L_{\mathrm{max}}}$]{\includegraphics[]{smtow_clmax.pdf}}

 \end{subfigmatrix}
    \caption{\textbf{Trade space of aircraft weight, number of passengers and runway length for advanced technology assumptions.}}
 \label{f:tech}
\end{figure}

Note that increasing the maximum lift coefficient or the deceleration factor has no effect for higher runway lengths.  
This is because at higher runway lengths the size of the aircraft is constrained by the range requirement but not the runway requirement. 
Increasing the battery specific energy however, is always beneficial because that lowers the battery weight which improves the whole system. 

\subsection{Point of Departure Vehicle}

A point of departure vehicle was sized for both the conservative case and aggressive case, whose parameter values are listed in Table~\ref{t:techparams}.  
Key variable values for both solutions are listed in Table~\ref{t:pod}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Design Variables}
    \label{t:pod}
    \begin{tabular}{l c c}
    \toprule
    \toprule
    Parameter                   & Conservative Case  & Aggressive Case \\ \hline
    $W_{\mathrm{MTO}}$          & 2700 [lbf]         & 2000 [lbf] \\
    $W_{\mathrm{batt}}$         & 900 [lbf]          & 500 [lbf] \\
    $N_{\mathrm{pax}}$          & 5                  & 5  \\
    $AR$                        & 10                 & 9 \\
    $b$                         & 38 [ft]            & 28 [ft] \\
    $(W/S)$                     & 18 [lbf/ft$^2$]    & 23 [lbf/ft$^2$] \\
    $S_{\mathrm{runway}}$       & 400 [ft]           & 200 [ft] \\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

One significant advantage this aircraft offers over an electric VTOL vehicle is the capacity to carry more passengers.  The proposed vehicle can carry 5 persons, while electric VTOL vehicles are typically limited to 2.  
It is also noted that the runway length for the conservative case is 400 ft but runway lengths as short as 100 ft may be possible if all  of the advanced technology is used.  While all those benefits are unlikely to be realized in the near term, runway lengths of 200-300 feet are possibly if infrastructure availability requires it.  This is especially true if the speed or payload requirements are slightly reduced.  
This information can be used to inform infrastructure decisions.  

Figure~\ref{f:vehicle} shows a visualization of the point of departure vehicle based on the conservative technology estimates.  The high wing configuration improves passenger access, reduces ground effect on landing, and allows easy maintenance access to batteries.  A key feature of this point of departure design is that there will be sufficient space in the wing to store all the batteries.  This physical separation from the passengers and other battery packs helps manage the risk associated with thermal runaway, as it reduces the need for a firewall.  The wing primary structure could also become dual-purpose, carrying aerodynamic loads as well as physically isolating the battery packs.  This would minimize the weight penalty for battery containment.

\section{Infrastructure Feasibility}
As previously discussed, there is a substantial amount of airport infrastructure located outside of urban centers; however within an urban center, much less airport or runway infrastructure exists. This Boston case study will specifically consider feasible infrastructure within the urban center, using the runway length ranges from the vehicle study.  Key topics to address include what considerations drive the placement of STOLports, what are feasible location types, and how infrastructure availability changes with infrastructure type and required size.  Potential STOLport locations identified in this study  are on top of buildings, on elevated platforms above highways and railways, at ground level, and on barges. In examining potential STOLport locations, there is a focus on locations that connect to existing transportation infrastructure.

\paragraph{Site Considerations}
Site considerations are not driven solely by runway length. The minimum rectangular area upon which a STOLport can be built is defined by runway length as well as room for taxiways, clearway requirements, and space for parking and charging stations. Ground clearance area requirements are written in the FAA AC 150/5300 and are dependent on aircraft size and speed\cite{AC150}. For locations that may be space restricted, a STOLpad rather than a STOLport concept is possible.  STOLpads would consist of just the runway, with no parking or recharging stations. 

Site considerations are also dependent on obstacle-free approach and departure paths. The length, lateral size, and required slope of those paths is defined by the FAA\cite{AC150}; they are also dependent on vehicle size and speed\cite{AC150}. For this study, like other UAM studies\cite{Uber}, only VFR approach corridors are considered. The key drivers for site considerations are available ground area and clear approach and departure paths.\\

One other factor to consider when analyzing potential STOLport infrastructure is the weight capacity of the runway support structure. In Boston, there are currently five existing helipads on top of buildings within the city limits. The helipad construction allows for helicopters of maximum weight ranging from 10,000 to 22,000 pounds to land on the pads. This shows that with current construction materials and techniques, similar STOLports could be built to meet the landing requirements of the proposed conservative (2700lb MTOW) and agressive (2000lb MTOW) point of departure STOL vehicles.

\paragraph{Crosswind Mitigation}

An additional consideration for infrastructure availability is crosswind mitigation. In order to have a robust UAM system, wind should not be a prohibitive factor for operations. Specific considerations for the particular wind patterns of the city in question should be incorporated when deciding on infrastructure location. There are various techniques to mitigate for multiple wind directions. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Conventional Crosswind Runways}  This is a proven approach but increases the infrastructure footprint of the STOLport. To reduce the severity of this impact, the crosswind design could take credit for the headwind component inherent in triggering the switch to the crosswind runway. A rule of thumb says that take-off and landing distances are reduced by 1.5 $\%$  for each knot of headwind up to 20 knots\cite{Headwind}. 
\item \textbf{Circular STOLport} A circular pad with the diameter of the required runway length would allow crosswind-free landings from any direction.  The runway heading could be set dynamically based on the prevailing winds. This would require more complex approach and departure procedures, 360-degree obstacle clearance, and portable charging stations. 
\item \textbf{Independent Perpendicular STOLports} Multiple STOLports facing different directions can be built in the same general area.  This increases the required network density. 

\item \textbf{Rotating Barges} STOLports located on barges could be moored to allow for rotation into the wind. This would require an increased footprint in the waterways which needs to be deconflicted with boating channels.

\item \textbf{Vehicle Design} In addition to infrastructure design, the eSTOL vehicle design can be used to mitigate crosswind landings. Potential vehicle considerations are larger vertical stabilizers or control surfaces, rotating landing gear, and advanced flight controls.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Logan Airport Considerations}
One of the main locations for a STOLport would be at major hub airports. In Boston, Logan International Airport would act as both a connection to nodal transportation for the UAM network and a constant supply of passengers requesting on-demand mobility. Logan averages 1,062 operations (takeoffs and landings) per day\cite{LoganStats}, and has little capacity to increase the volume of conventional vehicle operations, especially in poor weather conditions\cite{LoganOps}. Therefore, under the current ATC system, UAM operations at Logan should not operate on the primary runways.

With required runway lengths of less than 500 feet, STOL aircraft could use runways and taxiways that are not active with the current wind direction. STOL aircraft could also receive landing clearance to land and hold short of active runways with their short landing capability.  Logan Airport has pre-existing infrastructure of runways and taxiways that would facilitate a STOL runway of at least 500 feet for each of the four standard wind configurations as shown in Figure~\ref{f:logan}.  All the sites shown are more than 4300ft from the nearest active runway.

\paragraph{Feasible Locations}
A network of notional sites within Boston was designed with the previous considerations in mind. The network of notional sites is shown in Figure~\ref{f:nsites}. Within the network there are four types of possible STOLport locations, which are also shown in Figure~\ref{f:nsites}. The four types of locations to place a STOLport are on top of a building, over a highway or railway, on a barge over a body of water, or on the ground. Visualizations for the four types of STOLport locations are shown in Figure~\ref{f:svis}. The barge location shows a runway and possible space for charging stations.  The highway or railway location shows a runway on an elevated structure, with a ramp for the aircraft to taxi down to a lower level with charging stations. The building location shows the possibility for crosswind runways depending on the area available, and space for charging stations are also shown. The ground location is similar to the building location with crosswind runways depending on the area available and charging stations again shown.

\paragraph{Scaling}
Buildings are the type of infrastructure location most dependent on runway length. Considerations for scaling an infrastructure network vary between the types of locations. At highway and railway locations, placing any length of runway is fairly easy because the length of highways and railways far exceeds the length of STOLport runways. For highways and railways, possible scaling challenges include the fact that highway and railway infrastructure is limited in downtown areas due to tunnels. For barges, many major cities are located by large bodies of water which allows for much available area in order to scale the number of barge locations. However barges must consider ways to connect to the shore and avoiding shipping lanes. Scaling a network of ground infrastructure locations is not  feasible in an urban center, aside from already existing airports. Buildings are generally widely available within an urban center, however buildings will require shorter runway lengths compared to the other locations because of limited rooftop area. 

	GIS building footprint data was analyzed in order to understand how building infrastructure varies with runway length. Again, buildings are the type of STOLport location most dependent on runway length, as discussed in the previous paragraph. GIS data provides the footprints of buildings in a city\cite{GIS_MA}\cite{GIS_CA}. Based on this GIS data, if at least one side of the building footprint was as long as a given runway length, then the footprint was counted as a possible building. Figure~\ref{f:heatmap} shows heat maps created using the building footprint GIS data for Boston and Los Angeles. The heat maps show that the possible buildings for different runway lengths are distributed throughout the city making it possible to scale an infrastructure network that is not all concentrated at one location. Using the same method of counting possible buildings from the GIS building footprint data, Figure~\ref{f:hist} shows data trends of possible buildings as a function of runway length in order to provide insight into the manner in which the number of available buildings varies with runway length. For runway lengths of 400-600 feet, it is feasible to place STOLports within an urban center; reducing the runway length to 300ft or below exponentially increases the number of potential locations.

\section{System Challenges and Risks}
There are several key challenges and risks that are inherent to the STOL UAM network that will require further study
\paragraph{High Density Infrastructure Availability}
At high network densities, the effects of approach path constraints on potential infrastructure locations require further investigation.  Local and federal regulations on building runways on top of pre-existing infrastructure should also be considered, as well as the cost of placing new infrastructure in an urban core. The required network density to reliably handle crosswinds is currently uncertain, and is likely to vary from city to city based on the prevalent local wind conditions.  In general, this analysis should be repeated for more locations to confirm the same trends. 
\paragraph{Congested Airspace Operations}
This is a risk present for any UAM network, but operations in the vicinity of a busy hub airport like Boston Logan require careful ATC coordination to ensure safe separation between all users of the airspace.   This is especially true for UAM aircraft landing at or near large hub airports.  This may be complicated by the reduced maneuverability of STOL aircraft compared to VTOL configurations. 
\paragraph{Vehicle Design} 
Additional work is needed to fully understand the STOL vehicle design space and validate the assumptions made in this study, especially with respect to the effectiveness of blown lift and thrust reversal systems.  Additionally, lightly wing loaded vehicles have high gust susceptibility, which may negatively impact passenger comfort and/or requiring a gust-damping system.  Additionally, the effect of crosswind considerations on vehicle design is an important part of the trade space, especially for these low-speed vehicles.  This is an important infrastructure/vehicle coupling. 
\paragraph{Noise and Community overflight} It is unclear that the noise levels generated by these vehicles will be low enough to allow widespread operations over noise-sensitive areas. More detailed modeling is required to understand the exact noise impact of these types of vehicles, relative to both eVTOL configurations and the annoyance threshold of the surrounding populations.  It is also recognized that the shallow (relative to an eVTOL) approach and departure angles mean that surrounding communities might experience more overflight below 500ft.  However, with the blown flaps and high T/W, very steep departure angles are possible, which minimizes noise exposure.  On approach, the power setting will be low so the primary negative effects of overflight (noise) should be reduced. 

\section{Conclusion}
This analysis has showed that eSTOL aircraft are a feasible option for a UAM network, with significant advantages relative to vehicle payload and certification risk.  Vehicle runway lengths as short as 200-300 ft are shown to be feasible with current technologies, although a cruise speed reduction or some advanced technology may be required to achieve 200ft.   Runway lengths above 400ft are readily achievable for eSTOL aircraft. 
Possible types of locations for STOLports identified in this study include on top of buildings, over highways and railways, on barges, or on the ground of existing airports. Building infrastructure is the type of location most dependent on runway length. The STOLport locations can support runway lengths of 400 to 600 feet. If a vehicle is able to land in a runway of 300 feet or less, then the number of possible STOLport locations exponentially increases. Landing in a runway length of 500 feet or less could allow for novel operations at existing major airports. The results of the infrastructure study indicate that it is possible to design a STOLport network in an urban center.
STOL aircraft offer a near-term pathway to implementing a UAM network, allowing a company to capture early market share and start developing the operational knowledge of how to conduct these types of operations in the existing ATC environment.  STOL is a low-risk way to advance, test, and refine the UAM concept and all underlying technologies and operational infrastructures.
